# TTP Assignment 2

Assignment for the Tech Talent Pipeline Summer 2023 Bootcamp

## Description

The following (12) are some of the most popular and used methods in functional languages:

- forEach
- map
- filter
- some
- every
- reduce
- includes
- indexOf
- push
- lastIndexOf
- Object.keys()
- Object.values()

For this assignment, you will recreate these methods using JavaScript functions. Make sure to carefully understand what each method is designed to do, and DO NOT use any of the respective native JS methods to implement your solutions. Also, keep in mind that these methods do not (except for push()) mutate the input array. We highly suggest utilizing Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs to understand how each method works and what arguments they take. Also look into Array.prototype.pop(), Array.prototype.shift(), and other methods for your own enrichment.

## Goal 
To improve my understanding of JavaScript syntax, functions, and higher-order functions, and to better understand JavaScript and Array methods.
